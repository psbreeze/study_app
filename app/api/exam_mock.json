So the correct answer in on demand. \\n\\n A Reserved Instance is a reservation of resources and capacity, for either one or three years, for a particular Availability Zone within a region. Unlike on-demand, when you purchase a reservation, you commit to paying for all of the hours of the 1- or 3-year term; in exchange, the hourly rate is lowered significantly.\\nFurthermore, when you purchase a reservation, you?e not just getting cost savings; you? also reserving the capacity that you need in that particular Availability Zone.\\n\\n Reserved Instances provide you with a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand instance pricing. You are assured that your Reserved Instance will always be available for the operating system (e.g., Linux/UNIX or Windows) and Availability Zone in which you purchased it.\\n\\nSpot instances provide the ability for customers to purchase compute capacity with no upfront commitment and at hourly rates usually lower than the On-Demand rate. Spot instances allow you to specify the maximum hourly price that you are willing to pay to run a particular instance type. Amazon EC2 sets a Spot Price for each instance type in each Availability Zone, which is the price all customers will pay to run a Spot instance for that given period. The Spot Price fluctuates based on supply and demand for instances, but customers will never pay more than the maximum price they have specified.\\n\\nOn-Demand instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.
